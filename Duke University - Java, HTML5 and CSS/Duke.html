  <h2> My favorite movie! </h2>
    <b> I enjoy watching horror movies as well movies that are based on true-life incidents as I seem to find them covering more implications of an individuals life </b>
    <br></br>
    <em> My favorite movie would be Captain Phillips! It was an intense movie and got the audience on the edge of their seats! </em>
    <p> Overall, all movies have their <em> own interesting points </em> however <b> horror stories </b> will also <em> continue to be my <b> personal favorite </b> </em>
